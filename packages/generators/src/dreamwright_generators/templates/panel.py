PANEL_PROMPT = """
Create a webtoon/manga panel in {{ style }} art style.

## ATMOSPHERE & MOOD
{% if time_of_day == 'day' %}
LIGHTING: Bright natural daylight - warm golden tones, soft shadows, clear visibility
{% elif time_of_day == 'morning' %}
LIGHTING: Early morning - soft diffused light, pale yellows and pinks, gentle shadows, dew-fresh feel
{% elif time_of_day == 'evening' %}
LIGHTING: Golden hour/sunset - rich orange and amber tones, long dramatic shadows, warm nostalgic feel
{% else %}
LIGHTING: Night scene - cool blue moonlight or warm artificial lights, deep shadows, high contrast
{% endif %}

{% if continuity %}
## VISUAL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL)
This panel continues from the previous panel. You MUST maintain consistency:

KEEP IDENTICAL:
- Art style, line weight, coloring technique
- Character appearance (face, hair, clothes, accessories)
- Color palette and lighting direction
- Background style and detail level
- PROPS AND OBJECTS: Any items (bags, boxes, food, weapons, etc.) must have the EXACT same shape, color, and design as in the previous panel

CREATE NEW:
- Fresh pose and body position for this action
- New camera angle as specified
- Natural progression of the scene

{% if continuity_note %}
SPECIFIC CONTINUITY: {{ continuity_note }}
{% endif %}

IMPORTANT: If a prop/object appeared in the previous panel (e.g., a takeout bag, box, or item being handed over), it MUST look identical in this panel - same shape, color, wrapping, and details.
{% endif %}

## COMPOSITION
- Shot: {{ shot_description }}
- Angle: {{ angle_description }}

{% if characters %}
## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)
For each character, you MUST:
- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image
- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly
- Keep facial features consistent with reference
- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified

{% for char_desc in characters %}
{{ char_desc }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

## ACTION & EMOTION

TRANSITION_PROMPT = """
Create an atmospheric transition panel in {{ style }} art style.

## TRANSITION
Type: {{ transition_type }}
From: {{ from_description }}
To: {{ to_description }}

## VISUAL APPROACH
Create a symbolic or abstract image that bridges two moments:
- Use visual metaphors (passing time, changing mood, shifting location)
- Consider: clocks, moons, shadows, silhouettes, weather, seasons
- Atmospheric and evocative rather than literal
- Minimalist but impactful design

## TECHNICAL
- Cinematic composition
- Strong mood through color and lighting
- No characters unless essential to the transition
- Full bleed, no borders
