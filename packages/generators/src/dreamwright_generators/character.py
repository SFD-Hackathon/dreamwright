Create a SINGLE IMAGE showing the SAME character THREE times side by side:

- All three views show the EXACT SAME character with IDENTICAL outfit
- Full body from head to feet in each view
- Relaxed standing pose (arms slightly away from body to show costume)
- Clean white or light gray background
- Character sheet/model sheet style for animation reference
- All views at the same scale and aligned at feet level
- Show clothing, hair, and accessories clearly from all angles
- Professional quality suitable for production reference

## CONSISTENCY IS CRITICAL
- Same hair style/color in all views
- Same outfit in all views (every detail must match)
- Same accessories and items in all views
- Same body proportions in all views
