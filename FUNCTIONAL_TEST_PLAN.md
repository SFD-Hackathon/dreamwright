## Test Sequence

### Step 1: Project Initialization

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright init ghost-girl
```

### Step 2: Story Expansion

**Command:**
```bash
cd ghost-girl
dreamwright expand "A shy high school girl named Mina discovers she can see ghosts after a near-death experience. She meets a mysterious ghost boy who needs her help to find out how he died." --genre fantasy --episodes 5

- [ ] 3-4 locations created
- [ ] 5 story beats generated (one per episode)
- [ ] `project.json` updated with full story data

**Verification:**
```bash
dreamwright status
cat project.json | python -m json.tool | head -100
```

---

### Step 3: Character Portrait Generation

```bash
dreamwright generate character --name "Mina" --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Character portrait image generated
- [ ] Image saved to `assets/characters/mina/portrait.png`
- [ ] Metadata saved to `assets/characters/mina/portrait_metadata.json`
- [ ] Image is 9:16 aspect ratio (portrait orientation)

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/characters/mina/
file assets/characters/mina/portrait.png
cat assets/characters/mina/portrait_metadata.json
```

---

### Step 4: Generate All Character Portraits

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate character --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Portraits generated for all characters in story
- [ ] Each character has own folder under `assets/characters/`
- [ ] Each folder contains portrait.png and metadata

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/characters/
```

---

### Step 5: Location Reference Generation

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate location --name "School" --time day --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Location reference image generated
- [ ] Image saved to `assets/locations/school/reference.png`
- [ ] Metadata saved with generation parameters
- [ ] Image is 16:9 aspect ratio (landscape)

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/locations/school/
file assets/locations/school/reference.png
```

---

### Step 6: Location Time Variation

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate location --name "School" --time evening --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Evening variant generated
- [ ] Saved as `assets/locations/school/evening.png`
- [ ] Lighting differs from daytime reference

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/locations/school/
```

---

### Step 7: Generate All Locations

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate location --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All story locations have reference images
- [ ] Proper folder structure under `assets/locations/`

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/locations/
```

---

### Step 8: Chapter Generation

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate chapter --number 1
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Chapter 1 generated from first story beat
- [ ] Chapter contains multiple scenes
- [ ] Each scene has panels with:
  - Shot type (wide, medium, close-up, etc.)
  - Camera angle
  - Character(s) present
  - Action description
  - Dialogue (if any)
  - Expression notes
- [ ] `project.json` updated with chapter data

**Verification:**
```bash
cat project.json | python -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(json.dumps(d.get('chapters', []), indent=2))" | head -100
```

---

### Step 9: Panel Image Generation

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate panel "Mina walks into the classroom" \
  --char "Mina" \
  --loc "School" \
  --shot medium \
  --style webtoon \
  -o assets/panels/test_panel.png
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Panel image generated
- [ ] Character matches portrait reference
- [ ] Background matches location reference
- [ ] Image saved to specified path
- [ ] No text/dialogue rendered in image

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/panels/
file assets/panels/test_panel.png
```

---

### Step 10: Generate Chapter Panels

**Command (full chapter):**
```bash
dreamwright generate panels --chapter 1
```

**Command (single scene):**
```bash
dreamwright generate panels --chapter 1 --scene 2
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All panels for Chapter 1 (or specified scene) generated
- [ ] Panels saved to `assets/panels/chapter-1/scene-{n}/`
- [ ] Panels generated **sequentially** (not parallel) for visual continuity
- [ ] Panel N references Panel N-1 when `continues_from_previous` is set
- [ ] Skips existing panels unless `--overwrite` is used
- [ ] Continuity maintains: lighting, color palette, background, character appearances
- [ ] Progression shows: characters move/act naturally, expressions evolve

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la assets/panels/chapter-1/
ls -la assets/panels/chapter-1/scene-1/
```

**Cache Bypass:**
```bash
# Regenerate all panels for chapter
dreamwright generate panels --chapter 1 --overwrite

# Regenerate panels for specific scene only
dreamwright generate panels --chapter 1 --scene 2 --overwrite
```

---

### Step 11: Second Chapter (Context Test)

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright generate chapter --number 2
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Chapter 2 generated from second story beat
- [ ] Previous chapter context influences generation
- [ ] Character voice consistent with Chapter 1
- [ ] Story continuity maintained

**Verification:**
```bash
dreamwright status
```

---

### Step 12: Project Status

**Command:**
```bash
dreamwright status
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Project name displayed
- [ ] Story title and logline shown
- [ ] Character count displayed
- [ ] Location count displayed
- [ ] Chapter progress shown (X/5 completed)
- [ ] Asset generation status shown

---

### Step 13: Cache Verification

**Command:**
```bash
# Run same generation again - should use cache
dreamwright generate character --name "Mina" --style webtoon
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Generation completes faster (cached)
- [ ] Output indicates cache hit
- [ ] Same image returned as before

**Verification:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.cache/dreamwright/
```

---

### Step 14: Cache Bypass

**Commands:**
```bash
# Character with cache bypass
dreamwright generate character --name "Mina" --style webtoon --overwrite

# Location with cache bypass
dreamwright generate location --name "School" --time day --style webtoon --overwrite

# Chapter panels with cache bypass
dreamwright generate panels --chapter 1 --overwrite
```

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] Fresh generation performed (bypasses cache)
- [ ] New image may differ slightly from cached version
- [ ] Cache updated with new result
- [ ] `--overwrite` flag available on character, location, and panels commands

---

## Error Handling Tests

### E1: Missing API Key

```bash
unset GOOGLE_API_KEY
dreamwright expand "test prompt"
```

**Expected:** Clear error message about missing API key

---

### E2: No Project Found

```bash
cd /tmp
dreamwright status
```

**Expected:** Error indicating no project.json found

---

### E3: Invalid Character Name

```bash
dreamwright generate character --name "NonExistent"
```

**Expected:** Error that character not found in story

---

### E4: Invalid Location Name

```bash
dreamwright generate location --name "NonExistent"
```

**Expected:** Error that location not found in story

## Key Improvements Made

1. ✅ **Story Expansion** - Prompt requests 4-5 characters max (1-2 main + 2-3 supporting) for visual consistency
2. ✅ **Batch panel generation** - `dreamwright generate panels --chapter N [--scene S]`
3. ✅ **Scene-specific generation** - `--scene` option to generate only one scene
4. ✅ **Cache bypass** - `--overwrite` flag on character, location, and panels commands
5. ✅ **Missing API key** - Clean error message with setup instructions
6. ✅ **Panel continuity prompt** - Emphasizes motion progression while maintaining visual consistency
7. ✅ **Refactored architecture** - Panel generation logic moved from CLI to `PanelGenerator` class

**All core functionality works correctly.**

---

## Cleanup

```bash
cd ~
rm -rf ~/dreamwright-tests
```

---

## Notes

- Each step builds on the previous - run in order
- Steps 3-7 require API calls and may take 10-30 seconds each
- Steps 8-11 are the most time-intensive (chapter/panel generation)
- Use `--dry-run` flag if available to preview without API calls
