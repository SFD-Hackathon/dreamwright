  "description": "Elara Vance is known as the 'Walking Disaster' of Aethelgard Academy. She trips over nothing, drops potions, and answers questions before teachers ask them. But Elara isn't clumsy; she is cursed with 'Chronos Sight,' seeing ten seconds into the future. She lives in a disorienting double-vision world where she must dodge debris that hasn't fallen yet. In a society where Prophets are imprisoned as unstable weapons, she plays the fool to survive.\n\nThe story takes place during the high-stakes Midterm Alchemy Exam. Elara has a terrifying vision: the star student, Kaelen, is going to add the wrong ingredient, causing a chain reaction that destroys the wing and kills him. Elara has one hour to sabotage the exam and prevent the disaster. Every attempt she makes to intervene subtly is thwarted by Kaelen's perfectionism and the strict proctor. As the clock ticks down to the fatal moment, Elara realizes she can't save him without using magic that will expose her secret identity. She must choose between her safety and her rival's life.",
