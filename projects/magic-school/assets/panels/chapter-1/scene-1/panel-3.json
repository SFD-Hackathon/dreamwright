  "prompt": "Create a webtoon/manga panel in webtoon art style.\n\n## ATMOSPHERE & MOOD\nLIGHTING: Early morning - soft diffused light, pale yellows and pinks, gentle shadows, dew-fresh feel\n\n## VISUAL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL)\nMatch the reference image for:\n- Art style, line weight, coloring technique\n- Character appearance (face, hair, clothes)\n- Color palette and lighting direction\n- Background style and detail level\n\nCreate NEW composition showing:\n- Fresh pose and body position for this action\n- New camera angle as specified\nMAINTAIN: Elara's movement should look unnaturally fast, almost blurred.\n\n## COMPOSITION\n- Shot: close-up shot focusing on face and expressions\n- Angle: low angle looking up, shows power or grandeur\n- Location: The Alchemy Lab (A circular stone room filled with fumes and bubbling sounds. It feels claustrophobic and volatile.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Dim, illuminated by green and orange liquid glows, Key Object: The central copper distiller that hisses rhythmically, Atmosphere: Suffocating, humid, tense, Palette: Rust orange, copper, toxic green\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Elara Vance** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Petite build, constantly looks sleep-deprived, hunched posture to appear smaller.\n  Visual details: Hair: Messy auburn bun with loose strands falling in face, Eyes: Amber eyes that glow faintly gold when predicting (hidden by glasses), Top: Oversized beige cable-knit sweater vest over untucked white shirt, Bottom: Faded navy pleated skirt, hem undone on one side, Footwear: Scuffed brown loafers with mismatched socks (one cream, one white), Accessories: Cracked round spectacles taped at the bridge (Signature Item)\n  Expression: scared\n  Position: left of frame\n**Kaelen 'Kael' Vross** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Tall, athletic build, rigid posture, immaculate presentation.\n  Visual details: Hair: Sleek silver hair, undercut style, perfectly coiffed, Eyes: Ice blue eyes, sharp and judgmental gaze, Top: Fitted navy academy blazer with gold trim and crest, Bottom: Tailored charcoal trousers with sharp crease, Footwear: Polished black dress shoes, Accessories: Silver pocket watch on a chain he checks constantly\n  Expression: shocked\n  Position: center of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nIn a blur of motion, Elara's hand snaps out. She catches the mug in mid-air just as Kaelen's elbow makes contact, preventing it from even wobbling. Her eyes are wide, pupils dilated.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
