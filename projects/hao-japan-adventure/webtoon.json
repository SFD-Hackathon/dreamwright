  "description": "Hao, a hapless but enthusiastic food blogger, is on a solo trip to Tokyo. Obsessed with finding a 'hidden gem' sushi bar mentioned on a dark web forum, he follows a trail of glowing lanterns down a disappearing alleyway in Shinjuku. He enters 'Iso-ya,' a restaurant that smells divine but feels wrong. He sits down, expecting Michelin stars, but realizes too late that the other patrons are Yokai (spirits) and the chef has just been devoured by his own ingredients.\n\nMistaken for the legendary 'Iron Gut' human chef promised to cater the night's banquet, Hao is thrust into the kitchen. He must team up with Yumi, a disgraced half-demon sous-chef, to prepare a meal for the terrifying Dragon Lord. If the food isn't perfect, Hao is on the menu. Armed only with his travel snacks, a camera, and a terrifyingly sharp magical knife, Hao must slice, dice, and survive the night.",
  "premise": "A foodie tourist looking for the ultimate sushi experience accidentally stumbles into a restaurant for man-eating monsters and must fake his way as a legendary chef to avoid becoming the main course.",
