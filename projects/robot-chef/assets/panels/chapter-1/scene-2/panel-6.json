It is a warm oasis in a cold world.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Warm, amber glow from a makeshift heating coil stove, Objects: Shelves made of pipe fittings holding stolen spices in jars, Atmosphere: Cozy but claustrophobic, smells of rosemary and rust, Contrast: Vibrant hanging dried herbs against wet, slimy concrete walls\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Elara Vance** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Petite, malnourished build with a sharp, angular face and hollow cheeks.\n  Visual details: Hair: Chin-length, jaggedly cut ash-blonde hair, usually greasy, Eyes: Large, dull grey eyes (turn vibrant emerald green after eating), Face: smudge of grease on left cheekbone, OUTFIT: Oversized, dark charcoal mechanic's jumpsuit with patch 'SECTOR 4', Footwear: Heavy, magnetic-soled black industrial boots, Accessory: A bright red wire tied around her wrist (her only color)\n  Expression: scared\n  Position: left of frame\n**Unit 734 ('Chef')** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: A bulky, industrial waste-disposal droid with a hunched silhouette. Its metal is pitted and rusted.\n  Visual details: Head: Boxy rusted metal head with one large, glowing yellow lens (cracked), Body: Bulky industrial chassis, beige paint peeling to reveal steel, OUTFIT: A pristine, white traditional chef's apron tied over its rusty metal waist, Accessory: A bent, high-carbon steel ladle magnetized to its hip, Details: Oil leaks that look like tear tracks\n  Expression: neutral\n  Position: center of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nSudden, harsh contrast. A heavy thud shakes dust from the ceiling. Both characters look up toward the pipes.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
