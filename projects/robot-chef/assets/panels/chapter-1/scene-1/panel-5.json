It is a warm oasis in a cold world.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Warm, amber glow from a makeshift heating coil stove, Objects: Shelves made of pipe fittings holding stolen spices in jars, Atmosphere: Cozy but claustrophobic, smells of rosemary and rust, Contrast: Vibrant hanging dried herbs against wet, slimy concrete walls\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Unit 734 ('Chef')** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: A bulky, industrial waste-disposal droid with a hunched silhouette.

Steam rises in a perfect spiral.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
