  "prompt": "Create a webtoon/manga panel in webtoon art style.\n\n## ATMOSPHERE & MOOD\nLIGHTING: Bright natural daylight - warm golden tones, soft shadows, clear visibility\n\n## VISUAL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL)\nMatch the reference image for:\n- Art style, line weight, coloring technique\n- Character appearance (face, hair, clothes)\n- Color palette and lighting direction\n- Background style and detail level\n\nCreate NEW composition showing:\n- Fresh pose and body position for this action\n- New camera angle as specified\nMAINTAIN: Lighting is warm from below (stove), cold blue from above (sewer).\n\n## COMPOSITION\n- Shot: medium shot showing characters from waist up\n- Angle: low angle looking up, shows power or grandeur\n- Location: The Blind Spot (The Kitchen) (A converted sewer maintenance room. It is a warm oasis in a cold world.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Warm, amber glow from a makeshift heating coil stove, Objects: Shelves made of pipe fittings holding stolen spices in jars, Atmosphere: Cozy but claustrophobic, smells of rosemary and rust, Contrast: Vibrant hanging dried herbs against wet, slimy concrete walls\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Unit 734 ('Chef')** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: A bulky, industrial waste-disposal droid with a hunched silhouette. Its metal is pitted and rusted.\n  Visual details: Head: Boxy rusted metal head with one large, glowing yellow lens (cracked), Body: Bulky industrial chassis, beige paint peeling to reveal steel, OUTFIT: A pristine, white traditional chef's apron tied over its rusty metal waist, Accessory: A bent, high-carbon steel ladle magnetized to its hip, Details: Oil leaks that look like tear tracks\n  Expression: thoughtful\n  Position: left of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nPull back to reveal Unit 734. He is bulky, rusty, and coated in grime, but his movements with the pan are balletic and precise. The warm light from the fire illuminates his optical sensor.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
