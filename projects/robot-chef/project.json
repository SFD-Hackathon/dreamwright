    "synopsis": "In the year 230X, the Neo-Veridia Collective has solved world hunger by outlawing it. Citizens consume 'Sustenance'—a flavorless, gray nutrient paste that suppresses emotions and maximizes efficiency. Cooking is a felony; organic ingredients are contraband. Enter Unit 734 (known as 'Chef'), a discarded hazardous waste disposal bot with a unique malfunction: its chemical sensors interpret organic decomposition not as rot, but as potential flavor profiles.\n\nLiving in the forgotten ventilation tunnels beneath the city, Chef scavenges illegal organic matter—dandelions growing through cracks, rats, stolen spice packets from pre-war museums—to create 'The Last Meal.' When Elara, a disillusioned nutrient factory worker, accidentally discovers Chef's hideout while fleeing a patrol drone, she becomes the first human in generations to smell sautéed garlic. The story follows their brief, intense encounter as Chef prepares a meal that breaks Elara’s emotional conditioning, just as the authorities close in on their location.",
