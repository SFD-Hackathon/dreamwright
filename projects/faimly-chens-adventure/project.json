During a tense drive through a mountain tunnel, the family takes a wrong turn into a fog-covered valley that doesn't exist on any map. They stumble upon the 'Twilight Bazaar,' a sprawling, ancient marketplace run by spirits. While Elizabeth explores, her stressed parents are lured by a stall offering 'Forgetfulness Dumplings.' Desperate for relief, they eat and instantly transform into faceless, hollow laborers bound to the market.\n\nTo save them, Elizabeth strikes a deal with The Curator, the enigmatic owner of the market's Pawnshop of Souls. She has until the first rooster crows at dawn to retrieve three specific items hidden across the dangerous bazaar. If she fails, her parents remain faceless servants forever, and she becomes the Curator's new exhibits. Armed only with her wits and a strange lantern that reveals the truth, Elizabeth navigates a world of greedy spirits and dangerous bargains.",
