  "description": "Mia, a 17-year-old recovering from a near-drowning, discovers that the static in her noise-canceling headphones has been replaced by the whispers of the dead. While trying to ignore the supernatural world, she is ambushed at a subway station by a 'Glitch Spirit'\u2014a vengeful ghost manipulating electricity to manifest. She is barely saved by Silas, a cynical, legally blind detective who hunts spirits using sound waves rather than sight.\n\nSilas reveals that the Glitch Spirit is a serial killer who died in the subway and is now using the city's power grid to gain strength. He needs Mia's unique 'sight' to locate the spirit's physical anchor before midnight, or the ghost will become powerful enough to kill thousands. Reluctantly, Mia agrees to help, driven by the guilt of surviving her own accident.\n\nTracking the energy signature to an abandoned arcade, the duo faces the spirit on its home turf. Mia must overcome her paralysis in the face of death to act as a human lightning rod, baiting the spirit so Silas can sever its connection to the living world. The victory cements an uneasy alliance: Mia provides the eyes, and Silas provides the exorcism.",
  "premise": "After a drowning accident leaves her attuned to the frequency of the dead, a withdrawn teen must partner with a blind exorcist to stop a digital poltergeist from claiming its next victim.",
