  "title": "Neon Ronin: The Glitch Blade",
  "description": "Kenji, a former corporate enforcer discarded for adhering to an obsolete code of honor, survives in the underbelly of Neo-Tokyo as a 'glitch-hunter.' He wields a unique weapon: a katana hardwired to a portable server, capable of physically severing network connections and hacking systems upon impact. When a job to steal a high-security data drive goes wrong, Kenji discovers the drive isn't just data\u2014it holds the digitized consciousness of his sister, who was murdered by the very megacorp he used to serve.\n\nHunted by 'The Shogunate,' a ruthless corporate security force led by his former rival Kuro, Kenji teams up with Riko, a chaotic teenage net-runner. Together, they must navigate the vertical slums of Sector 4 to decrypt the drive before the corporation can remotely wipe it. As the countdown to the wipe begins, Kenji must choose between his physical survival and the preservation of his sister's digital soul.\n\nThe final confrontation takes place atop the corporate spire, where steel meets silicon. Kenji must unleash the full potential of the Glitch Blade, risking his own mind to cut the connection to the mainframe and free his sister into the decentralized web, becoming a legend in the process.",
  "premise": "In a neon-drenched Tokyo where honor is obsolete, a disgraced cyborg swordsman must hack the ultimate firewall using a blade that cuts through steel and code alike to save the soul of his murdered sister.",
