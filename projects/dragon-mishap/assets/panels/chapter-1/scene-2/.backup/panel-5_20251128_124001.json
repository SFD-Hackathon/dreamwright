You MUST maintain consistency:\n\nKEEP IDENTICAL:\n- Art style, line weight, coloring technique\n- Character appearance (face, hair, clothes, accessories)\n- Color palette and lighting direction\n- Background style and detail level\n- PROPS AND OBJECTS: Any items (bags, boxes, food, weapons, etc.) must have the EXACT same shape, color, and design as in the previous panel\n\nCREATE NEW:\n- Fresh pose and body position for this action\n- New camera angle as specified\n- Natural progression of the scene\n\nSPECIFIC CONTINUITY: Backpack is worn leather.\n\nIMPORTANT: If a prop/object appeared in the previous panel (e.g., a takeout bag, box, or item being handed over), it MUST look identical in this panel - same shape, color, wrapping, and details.\n\n## COMPOSITION\n- Shot: close-up shot focusing on face and expressions\n- Angle: dutch angle (tilted), creates tension or unease\n- Location: The Academy Attic (Lily's living quarters. Cramped, chaotic, and magical.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Golden hour dust motes dancing in light beams, Object: Stacks of floating books that form a staircase, Atmosphere: Cozy but claustrophobic, Color Palette: Warm browns, parchment beige, ink black\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Lily** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Petite, messy rose-gold hair tied in a loose side braid. Large, expressive teal eyes behind round, slightly crooked glasses. Always has ink smudges on her cheek.\n  Visual details: Hair: Rose-gold, messy side braid with loose strands, Outfit: Oversized navy blue wizard robe with gold constellation patches, Accessory: A battered wooden staff held together with duct tape, Footwear: Mismatched brown leather boots, Build: Short, constantly tripping or hunched over books\n  Expression: panicked\n  Position: left of frame\n**Ember (formerly Ignis)** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: A morbidly obese orange tabby cat. His eyes are vertical dragon slits (glowing gold).\n  Visual details: Body: Fat orange tabby cat, Distinctive Feature: Tiny, useless membranous dragon wings on his back, Accessory: A red velvet collar with a heavy gold coin pendant, Expression: Perpetually unimpressed / half-lidded eyes, Movement: Floats slightly when too lazy to walk\n  Expression: exhausted\n  Position: center of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nLily violently stuffs Ember into her leather backpack. Only his annoyed face is visible sticking out of the top flap.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
