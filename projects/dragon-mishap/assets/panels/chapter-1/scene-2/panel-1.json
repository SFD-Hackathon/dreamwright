Cramped, chaotic, and magical.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Golden hour dust motes dancing in light beams, Object: Stacks of floating books that form a staircase, Atmosphere: Cozy but claustrophobic, Color Palette: Warm browns, parchment beige, ink black\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Lily** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Petite, messy rose-gold hair tied in a loose side braid. Large, expressive teal eyes behind round, slightly crooked glasses. Always has ink smudges on her cheek.\n  Visual details: Hair: Rose-gold, messy side braid with loose strands, Outfit: Oversized navy blue wizard robe with gold constellation patches, Accessory: A battered wooden staff held together with duct tape, Footwear: Mismatched brown leather boots, Build: Short, constantly tripping or hunched over books\n  Expression: devastated\n  Position: left of frame\n**Ember (formerly Ignis)** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: A morbidly obese orange tabby cat. His eyes are vertical dragon slits (glowing gold).\n  Visual details: Body: Fat orange tabby cat, Distinctive Feature: Tiny, useless membranous dragon wings on his back, Accessory: A red velvet collar with a heavy gold coin pendant, Expression: Perpetually unimpressed / half-lidded eyes, Movement: Floats slightly when too lazy to walk\n  Expression: neutral\n  Position: center of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nLily is pulling at her hair, staring at the cat in horror. Ember is licking his paw nonchalantly.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
