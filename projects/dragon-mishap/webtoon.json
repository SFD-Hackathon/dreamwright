  "title": "My Dragon is a Cat?!",
  "description": "Lily is the worst student at the Royal Magic Academy, not because she lacks power, but because she lacks control. During a routine polishing of the Guardian Dragon's scales, a sneeze-induced spell transforms the majestic beast, Ignis, into a chubby, sarcastic orange tabby cat who prefers to be called Ember. With the Grand Dragon Festival only three days away, Lily faces exile if the kingdom discovers the Guardian is missing.\n\nDesperate, Lily drags the complaining cat-dragon on a quest to the Whispering Mountains to find a Reversal Crystal. They are intercepted by Marcus, a knight with too much enthusiasm and zero sense of direction, who insists on 'escorting' them. As they navigate forests that feed on insecurity and spirits that hoard memories, Lily discovers that Ignis (now Ember) was actually lonely at the top. The journey forces Lily to embrace her chaotic magic rather than suppress it, realizing that a perfect wizard isn't as useful as a brave one.",
  "premise": "After accidentally transforming the kingdom's terrifying guardian dragon into a sarcastic house cat, a clumsy wizard apprentice has three days to reverse the spell before the Royal Festival reveals her disaster.",
