    "synopsis": "Lily is the worst student at the Royal Magic Academy, not because she lacks power, but because she lacks control. During a routine polishing of the Guardian Dragon's scales, a sneeze-induced spell transforms the majestic beast, Ignis, into a chubby, sarcastic orange tabby cat who prefers to be called Ember. With the Grand Dragon Festival only three days away, Lily faces exile if the kingdom discovers the Guardian is missing.\n\nDesperate, Lily drags the complaining cat-dragon on a quest to the Whispering Mountains to find a Reversal Crystal. They are intercepted by Marcus, a knight with too much enthusiasm and zero sense of direction, who insists on 'escorting' them. As they navigate forests that feed on insecurity and spirits that hoard memories, Lily discovers that Ignis (now Ember) was actually lonely at the top. The journey forces Lily to embrace her chaotic magic rather than suppress it, realizing that a perfect wizard isn't as useful as a brave one.",

Smoke clears to reveal a fat orange cat sitting in the dragon's hoard. The cat speaks: 'Well, this is humiliating.' The High Wizard knocks on the door asking if everything is ready for the festival in 3 days. Cliffhanger: Lily shoves the cat into her backpack and jumps out the window."

Enter Marcus, a knight seeking glory. He thinks the 'cat' is a demon possessing Lily. After a chaotic misunderstanding involving a levitation spell gone wrong, Marcus agrees to help them find the Crystal, thinking it's a quest for glory. Cliffhanger: The map flies into the Whispering Woods, a place known for driving travelers mad."

The visual motif of 'Static Scribbles' surrounds Lily. Marcus tries to fight the voices with a sword. Ember, unaffected because he's arrogant, purrs on Lily's lap, the vibration shattering the static. Discovery: Ember admits he likes being small because he can finally be held. Cliffhanger: They reach the cave, but the Crystal is being used as a nightlight by a massive Stone Golem."

Instead of fighting, she uses her 'clumsy' magic to conjure a fireworks display (intended to be a fireball) that entertains the Golem. The Golem laughs, crumbling slightly to reveal the Crystal. Lily grabs it. The sun begins to rise on the day of the Festival. They rush back. Cliffhanger: As they cast the reversal spell at the city gates, the Crystal cracks."

Ignis gives Lily a subtle wink (and demands a giant saucer of milk later). Marcus is knighted for 'taming the beast.' Lily accepts her role as the 'Chaos Wizard.' Final Shot: Lily walking away, tripping over her own robe, while a giant dragon tail catches her gently."
