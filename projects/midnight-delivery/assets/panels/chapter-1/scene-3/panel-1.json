Where Ren died.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Harsh yellow streetlamps casting long shadows, Atmosphere: Cold, empty, ominous, Palette: Greys, blacks, and stark yellow light, Sensory: The sound of a single dripping drain\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Kai** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Lean, tired, messy hair hidden by a helmet. Looks like he hasn't slept in weeks.\n  Visual details: Hair: Messy jet-black hair, often damp from rain, Eyes: Sharp dark eyes with permanent purple bags under them, Outfit: Oversized yellow/black windbreaker with 'RUSH' logo on back, Bottom: Faded dark grey denim jeans with grease stains, Footwear: Scuffed black combat boots, Accessories: A cracked smartphone with a distinct blue light glow\n  Expression: neutral\n  Position: left of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nKai sits on his bike at a red light.
