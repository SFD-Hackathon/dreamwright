  "prompt": "Create a webtoon/manga panel in webtoon art style.\n\n## ATMOSPHERE & MOOD\nLIGHTING: Bright natural daylight - warm golden tones, soft shadows, clear visibility\n\n## VISUAL CONTINUITY (CRITICAL)\nThis panel continues from the previous panel. You MUST maintain consistency:\n\nKEEP IDENTICAL:\n- Art style, line weight, coloring technique\n- Character appearance (face, hair, clothes, accessories)\n- Color palette and lighting direction\n- Background style and detail level\n- PROPS AND OBJECTS: Any items (bags, boxes, food, weapons, etc.) must have the EXACT same shape, color, and design as in the previous panel\n\nCREATE NEW:\n- Fresh pose and body position for this action\n- New camera angle as specified\n- Natural progression of the scene\n\nSPECIFIC CONTINUITY: The takeout box retains the red string detail from panel 5. Both characters are visible for the exchange.\n\nIMPORTANT: If a prop/object appeared in the previous panel (e.g., a takeout bag, box, or item being handed over), it MUST look identical in this panel - same shape, color, wrapping, and details.\n\n## COMPOSITION\n- Shot: close-up shot focusing on face and expressions\n- Angle: eye level, straight on view\n- Location: The Midnight Wok (A street food stall that only appears in a foggy alleyway after midnight. It smells of spices and ozone.) - Visual elements: Lighting: Sickly green and neon pink signage, Atmosphere: Steamy, claustrophobic but warm, Key Object: A hanging red lantern that glows blue when an order is ready, Sound: Sizzling oil that sounds like whispering voices\n## CHARACTERS (CRITICAL: Match reference images EXACTLY)\nFor each character, you MUST:\n- Use the EXACT same costume/outfit as shown in their reference image\n- Match hair color, style, and accessories exactly\n- Keep facial features consistent with reference\n- Only change: expression, pose, and camera angle as specified\n\n**Kai** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Lean, tired, messy hair hidden by a helmet. Looks like he hasn't slept in weeks.\n  Visual details: Hair: Messy jet-black hair, often damp from rain, Eyes: Sharp dark eyes with permanent purple bags under them, Outfit: Oversized yellow/black windbreaker with 'RUSH' logo on back, Bottom: Faded dark grey denim jeans with grease stains, Footwear: Scuffed black combat boots, Accessories: A cracked smartphone with a distinct blue light glow\n  Expression: confused\n  Position: left of frame\n**Madam Zhu** (MUST match reference image exactly)\n  Appearance: Short, stern, moves with impossible speed.\n  Visual details: Hair: Silver hair pulled into a tight traditional bun with a jade pin, Outfit: Traditional navy blue Cheongsam top, Accessories: A modern digital stopwatch hanging around her neck, Prop: A massive iron wok that smokes with purple steam, Eyes: Milky white (blind), but she looks directly at people\n  Expression: serious\n  Position: center of frame\n\n## ACTION & EMOTION\nMadam Zhu thrusts the takeout box into Kai's hands. The box is distinct—cardboard tied with a thick red string instead of tape. Kai instinctively grabs it, looking bewildered by her intensity. Steam from the wok curls around their joined hands like a binding rope, obscuring the counter between them.\n\n## VISUAL EFFECTS (if appropriate)\n- Motion lines for movement\n- Speed lines for action\n- Sparkles/glow for magical/emotional moments\n- Dramatic lighting for tension\n\n## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS\n- FULL BLEED composition (art to all edges, NO white borders)\n- NO text, speech bubbles, or sound effects in image\n- Clean professional linework\n- Expressive faces with clear emotions\n- Dynamic poses with weight and balance\n- Rich background detail that supports the mood",
