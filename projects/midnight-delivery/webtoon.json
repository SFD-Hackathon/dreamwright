  "description": "Kai, an exhausted engineering student drowning in debt, works the graveyard shift for a generic food delivery app. One rainy night, his app glitches, turning a ghostly blue and displaying high-paying orders from a restaurant that doesn't exist on any map: 'The Midnight Wok.' Desperate for the payout, he accepts.\n\nHe discovers that between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM, the veil between the living and the dead thins. His customers are spirits who cannot move on until they taste the specific meal that ties them to their biggest regret. If Kai fails to deliver before the clock strikes 1:00 AM, the spirits become Wandering Shades, trapped forever. \n\nThe episodic jobs escalate until Kai receives an order from a 'User_Ren'\u2014his estranged older brother who died in a motorcycle accident three years ago. The order is simple: 'Mom's Spicy Tofu Stew.' To complete the delivery, Kai must confront the guilt he\u2019s been harboring since the night his brother died.",
