While trying to escape a sudden, strange weather phenomenon\u2014a sun-shower (Fox Rain)\u2014he chases a runaway sketch page down a narrow, fog-filled alleyway that shouldn't exist.\n\nHe emerges not in the city he knows, but in 'The Twilight District,' a liminal space where spirits masquerade as humans to enjoy earthly delights. Here, he meets Yuki, a mischievous shopkeeper who claims she can fix his ruined sketches using 'Kintsugi' magic\u2014gold repair for the soul. \n\nFor one magical hour, Hao experiences the 'good time' he was promised, seeing the architecture of the spirit world.
