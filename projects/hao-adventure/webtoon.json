  "description": "Hao, an audiophile and field recorder, is obsessed with capturing 'pure silence'\u2014a metaphor for the peace he hasn't felt since his twin sister vanished years ago. His search leads him to the Deep Sector of the Blackwood Forest, a restricted area known for magnetic anomalies. While recording near an ancient, lightning-struck banyan tree, his equipment picks up a rhythmic, mechanical thrumming that mimics a human heartbeat.\n\nAs he investigates, reality begins to distort around the tree. The moss turns from green to a digital violet, and the air ripples like water. Hao realizes the tree isn't a plant, but a wound in the world. Through the gap, he sees a landscape of floating geometric islands and hears his sister's voice calling for help. Driven by desperation, Hao steps through the anomaly just as the forest rangers arrive to stop him.\n\nHe lands in the 'Echo Plane,' a dimension where sound waves are visible light. But he isn't alone. A guardian entity\u2014a construct of static and bone\u2014blocks his path. Hao must use his recording equipment to manipulate the frequencies of this new world to survive the first encounter, realizing that to save his sister, he must master the noise that threatens to consume him.",
