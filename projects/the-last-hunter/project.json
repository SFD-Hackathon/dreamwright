During a raid on a D-Rank dungeon, his party stumbles into a hidden 'Double Dungeon'—a terrifying temple filled with god-like statues. The raid leader, Kang, betrays the group to escape, leaving Jin-woo and a timid healer named Hana to die. As a massive stone statue brings its blade down, a holographic screen freezes time: [You have met the hidden requirements. Will you accept the Player role?]. Jin-woo accepts, escaping death but waking up in a hospital three days later. Now, he sees 'Quests' floating in the air. To survive the penalties and save his mother, he must enter an 'Instance Dungeon' located inside a subway station and kill the boss, transforming from prey into the ultimate predator.",
