The lighting shifts when she focuses on spirits.- Shot: wide establishing shot showing full environment and characters\n- Angle: dutch angle (tilted), creates tension or unease\n\nCHARACTERS (draw with correct human anatomy and proportions):\n- Character 'Mina Kim' (short black bob hair, pale skin, large white headphones, oversized beige cardigan, tired dark circles under eyes) - Expression: neutral - Position: left of frame\n\nACTION: The camera pans slightly to reveal what Mina is ignoring. Grotesque, shadowy spirits are clinging to the lockers and hanging upside down from the ceiling tiles, reaching out toward passing students.\n\nFORMAT:\n- FULL BLEED: artwork extends to ALL edges, no white borders\n- No speech bubbles or text in the image\n\nQUALITY:\n- Clean linework, correct anatomy and body proportions\n- Expressive faces, dynamic poses\n- Professional webtoon art quality",
