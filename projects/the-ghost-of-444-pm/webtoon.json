  "description": "Mina Kim was always the 'invisible girl' at school, too shy to speak up. But after surviving a catastrophic bus accident that should have killed her, she returns to school with a terrifying new ability: she can see the dead. While trying to ignore the grotesque spirits wandering the halls, she stumbles upon Kai, a ghost different from the others. He looks human, retains his sanity, and haunts the abandoned music room.\n\nKai has no memory of who he was or how he died; he only knows he's been waiting for someone to hear him. Despite her fear, Mina agrees to be his bridge to the living world. As they uncover clues\u2014an old yearbook, a dusty guitar, and a suppressed police report\u2014they realize Kai's death wasn't an accident. With a dark entity known as a 'Hollow' tracking Kai to consume his fading soul, Mina must find the courage to confront the truth of the past, connecting Kai's tragedy to the very accident that changed her life.",
